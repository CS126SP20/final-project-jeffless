# ToBoard

Author: Jeffrey Lin

## Core Project Proposal
ToBoard is a collaborative whiteboard which allows students to work on problems together. Students can simultaneously 
draw on an empty whiteboard.

In 2016, I created a bare-bones version of this app for Android, but never found a market for it. However, in our
current situation, with most students learning remotely, a platform like this is incredibly relevant. Furthermore, this 
project is personal to me since it aligns with my belief that technology should be aimed at promoting social good. 
This platform could provide students facing adversity an opportunity to learn that they otherwise would not have access 
to.
